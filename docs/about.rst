The BioSamples Service
-----------------------

BioSamples is a freely available sample repository for the deposition and exploration of samples used in various projects and contexts.
The resource provides unique accessions for publications, and functions as a constantly-updating archive of sample metadata, utilising community standards from the GSC (Genomic Standards Consortium) and beyond.

Do you have **submission queries?** Still need support after reading our help pages? Email us at biosamples@ebi.ac.uk!

We welcome enquiries on data submission and data access, as well as more technical issues, e.g. integration with other databases, linked open data, etc. Feedback on data content as well as new features requests are also welcome.

If you use BioSamples Database regularly, or maintain software that interacts with it, you may want to keep up to date with any changes and extensions to the functionalities by subscribing to the `**biosamples-announce mailing list** <https://listserver.ebi.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/biosamples-announce>`_. This is a very low volume list which includes mostly infromation about new releases and downtimes.
