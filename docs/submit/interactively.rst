How to Register Samples Interactively
=====================================

This guide details how to register samples interactively in BioSamples through an ordinary web browser without having to go through the technical challenges of using an API.
If you want to create a process for syncing samples programmatically, refer to the `BioSamples JSON API <programatically.html>`_.

Requirements
------------

You will need a WEBIN submission account to proceed with this route. Please refer to `'Registering a WEBIN Submission Account' <general-guide/registration.html>`_ for more information.

Overview
--------

There are two BioSamples portals: one for test registrations and another for production (real) registrations. The test service allows you to trial the interface in a consequence-free manner.

- **Test service URL**: https://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/submit
- **Production service URL**: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/submit

We advise and encourage that you trial your registration using the BioSamples test service before using the production service.

Broadly, interactive sample registration involves completing a tsv template spreadsheet with the necessary metadata, validating, and submitting the spreadsheet to the BioSamples online web browser.
In the next section we break this down into individual steps.
