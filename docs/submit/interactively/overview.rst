Overview
=========
This guide details how to register samples interactively in BioSamples through a web browser without having to go through the technical challenges of using an API.
If you would like to create a process for syncing samples programmatically, refer to the `BioSamples JSON API <../programmatically.html>`_.

Requirements
------------
You will need a WEBIN submission account to proceed with this route. Please refer to `'Registering a WEBIN Submission Account' <../general-guide/registration.html>`_ for more information.


Portals
-------
There are two BioSamples portals: one for test registrations and another for production (real) registrations. We advise that you trial your submission using the BioSamples test service before submitting to the production service.

- **Test service URL**: https://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/submit
- **Production service URL**: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/submit


Broadly, interactive sample registration involves completing a tsv template spreadsheet with the necessary metadata, validating, and submitting the spreadsheet to the BioSamples online web browser.
In the next section we break this down into individual steps.
